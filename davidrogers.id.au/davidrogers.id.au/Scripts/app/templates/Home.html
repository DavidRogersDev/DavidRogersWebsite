        <p>Hi, I’m dave.

        <p>I am a .NET developer based in Adelaide, South Australia, Australia.

        <p>I have been writing code since my humble beginnings of teaching myself HTML way back in 1997.

        <p>Developers have to keep up-to-date in this fast moving space and I value self-training highly. To that end, I invest in myself every year through both the purchase of text books and online training courses. I also take the time to view videos from presentations given at various conferences around the world.

        <p>I have experience in both rich-client and web development, including the technologies cycling in the image fader to the right. I try to write as much code as I can in my own time and have included some of the code on my Github page which is viewable by the link below.

        <p>I am also the project coordinator and sole developer of <a ng-href="{{winformsmvpUrl}}">WinformsMVP</a>. You can click on the <strong>projects</strong> link below for more information on that framework.
